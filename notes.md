# more plugins to consider

- which-key: show pending key combinations
- lualine: better statusline (alternatives?)
- dap plugins for debug support
- autopairs for auto closing brackets
- nvim-ts-autotag -> utils for html/xml tags
- chrisgrieser/nvim-various-textobjs -> textobjects: html tags, indentation (among others)
- vim-easyclip: better(?) clipboard functionality
- akinsho/bufferline.nvim -> better looking tabs
- ahmedkhalf/project.nvim -> navigate between projects (with telescope integration!)
- maybe tabnine?
- noice: different UI for messages, ex mode etc
- leap: navigation
- clever-f: better fFtT functionality


# required capabilities

- comments -> done
- autoformat -> use lsp, needs configurig
- navigation -> telescope, needs more configuring
- textobjects -> mostly done through treesitter, maybe add vim-surround or similar?
- refactoring tools -> todo (maybe with primagens plugin)
- git -> diff, merge, staging seperate hunks etc. not clear yet
- tree exploring -> todo (nvim-tree?)
- terminal -> todo (toggleterm?)
- debugging -> todo, dap
- run from nvim, e.g. via gradle -> todo
- gradle -> todo
