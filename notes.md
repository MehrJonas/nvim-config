# more plugins to consider

- dap plugins for debug support
- vim-easyclip: better(?) clipboard functionality
- maybe tabnine?
- noice: different UI for messages, ex mode etc -> branch
- leap: navigation
- junegunn/gv.vim -> git
- vim-test-vim-test for running tests



# required capabilities
- tree exploring -> nvim tree: done. todo: add ranger-like functionality?
- debugging -> todo, dap
- run from nvim, e.g. via gradle -> todo
- gradle -> todo

- completions -> done (can use some more config)
- comments -> done
- autoformat -> use lsp, needs more configurig
- navigation -> telescope, needs more configuring
- git -> neogit, diffview -> needs configuring
- terminal -> todo (toggleterm?)
- better :w / :x / :q behaviour (maybe just remap :w -> :wa, :x -> :xa?)
- tabs, windows -> keymaps ?

# vim-native stuff to learn
- jumplist
- marks
- management of buffers / windows / tabs


# other todos
- which-key -> configure
- find better mappings for completions
- configure neogit
