# more plugins to consider

- dap plugins for debug support
- chrisgrieser/nvim-various-textobjs -> textobjects: html tags, indentation (among others)
- vim-easyclip: better(?) clipboard functionality
- akinsho/bufferline.nvim -> better looking tabs
- ahmedkhalf/project.nvim -> navigate between projects (with telescope integration!)
- maybe tabnine?
- noice: different UI for messages, ex mode etc
- leap: navigation
- clever-f: better fFtT functionality


# required capabilities
- completions -> done (can use some more config)
- comments -> done
- autoformat -> use lsp, needs configurig
- navigation -> telescope, needs more configuring
- textobjects -> mostly done -> maybe add nvim-various-textobjs
- refactoring tools -> todo (maybe with primagens plugin)
- git -> neogit, diffview -> needs configuring
- tree exploring -> nvim tree: done. todo: add ranger-like functionality?
- terminal -> todo (toggleterm?)
- debugging -> todo, dap
- run from nvim, e.g. via gradle -> todo
- gradle -> todo
- better :w / :x / :q behaviour (maybe just remap :w -> :wa, :x -> :xa?)
- tabs, windows -> keymaps ?


# other todos
- which-key -> configure
- find better mappings for completions
